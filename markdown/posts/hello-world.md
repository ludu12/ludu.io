summary: 'First blog post. Motivation and a little bit about me.'

# Motivation  
I made this blog to explore and practice web development as well as curate better habits in managing my time. 

I think it helps having something like a blog or journal to write in when developing habits, simply because of the repetition and cadence. 

It's my hope that writing in this blog on a regular basis helps me think more carefully where my time is going. And perhaps exercises whatever semblance of creativity I still have left in me...

# A little about me  
I'm 26 and I live in Des Moines, Iowa. I'm lucky to be married to the absolute best person I know and I have a dog named Olivia Benson (yes, like from Law & Order). My wife and I love to travel and run/bike around Des Moines (usually to breweries or restaurants). As you can imagine, Covid-19 has really put a damper on these things but we've found other things to do...

Some things that are currently interesting me and I enjoy thinking about are: 

- How do I cultivate good habits?
- What makes a good product and how can I make one?
- Various business ideas and ways to make money
- Home improvement
- Making Craft Cocktails

#### Stuff I Like:
- Coding 👨‍💻
- TV Shows 📺 
- Books 📚 (and audiobooks)
- Music 🎷
- Motorcycles 🛵
- Travelling 🧳
- Skiing ⛷ 
- Iowa Hawkeyes 🦅

#### Stuff I don't like:
- Cilantro 🤮
