## What I liked
I liked that this book was written like a novel. It keep the story interesting and dramatic despite the dry subject of corporate IT.

## What I didn't like
While there were several roadblocks and ultimately some good take aways from the book. 
Things seemed worked out a little <i>too</i> well.

## What I learned
Software Development can be managed like a manufacturing plant.
