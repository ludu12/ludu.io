# Motivation

So the gist of this exercise is to pin up small tasks/goals you want to accomplish in the near term on your mirror so
that you seem them every morning. These goals should be truthful and not sugar coated (i.e. don't lie to yourself, if
your overweight you need to lose weight). They should also be tangible and not too large. This way you can take smaller
steps to achieving a much larger goal. So if you have a goal of running a marathon maybe try setting a goal to run 1
mile (1.61 km) a day. The next week you could increase the distance and so on and so forth.

# Accountability Mirror

This challenge reminds me a lot of about another book I've read call Atomic Habits. In that book, the author talks about
making small iterative steps in order to build up a habit. These goals need to be concrete, and the less friction you
have on holding yourself accountable, the better. To idea using your daily routine (i.e. looking in a mirror in the
morning) fits nicely here.

I think the point of this challenge is really to start developing habits. A lot of our lives/mindset revolve around our
habits and some times, habits are the only way to stay disciplined.

One tip I've found extremely useful when developing habits (that I adopted from Atomic Habits) was the idea of using an
existing habit to piggy-back off of when developing a new habit. More specifically, using an existing habit's craving in
order to reward a new habit. For example, I have a habit of brushing my teeth in the morning and at night. The feeling
of a clean mouth is something I crave. So in order to satisfy this craving I do 20 push-ups *before* I allow myself to
brush my teeth in the morning. At night, I floss *before* I brush my teeth; a little gross I'll admit but effective.

#### Some tasks/goals I currently have:

- Learn something new about Typescript
- Run ~10 miles (16.09 km) a week
- 20 push-ups every day
- Floss every night
- Drop weight to 170s
