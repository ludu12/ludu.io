# Motivation

What are the things I've been through and succeeded? What 'trophies' can I claim in life, to use when I'm feeling down?

# Taking inventory of my cookie jar

As I've laid out in the first challenge, I've definitely been through some adversity and do feel like I've come out of
it stronger. From losing my dad to just figuring out life a little more in general. It's funny though, other than those
vague accomplishments, there aren't that many concrete things I can point to. I guess I tend to focus more on the bad
than the good.

### Some other achievements:

- Graduated from college
- Finished a half-marathon.
- Then later, ran a half-marathon under 2 hours
- Married my wife
- Negotiated a 35% raise after a years work
- Bought a house

One story I love to tell and think about is a class I had back in college sophomore year. I had just decided the
semester before to go into electrical engineering and was taking a class called *Linear Systems*. Linear systems is
basically the mathematics behind things like radio waves and signal processing. It was a pretty hard class and to top it
off, the grading for this class was pretty brutal. There were two mid-term tests and a final and that was it. So doing
poorly on any of the mid-term tests was a significant portion of your grade.

I ended up getting a whopping 20% on the first midterm. Failed it, and failed it bad. I was in serious risk of failing
this class. However, I buckled down, went to any of the office hours I could, and studied extensively for the next
midterm. Lucky for me there happened to be an extra credit question on this test, and I ended up getting 120% on the
next test. I put it on the fridge for my 4 other roommates to see.
