# Motivation

In the next several posts I'll be writing about the challenges from David Goggins'
book [Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279/).

Some posts are the challenges themselves where I'm tasked to write down something about my life. Other posts I'll just
be writing about my thoughts on the challenge.

The first challenge is to write down what my "bad hand" was in life. I've never been one to play the victim, 
but it is somewhat cathartic to write down these things, with the idea being to use that as motivation.

# What was my bad hand?

To be honest, I'm fortunate enough to say that I was dealt a pretty good hand.
Of course there was some adversity, but relatively speaking I think I've hit the
lottery in terms of socioeconomic factors. When shrouded by the veil of
ignorance and guaranteeing I could land in the spot I am now, I would choose
this life every time. That's a pretty positive thought (if I do say so myself)
and a good reminder whenever I'm feeling down.

With that being said, I do know there are some things that had they been different (or not happened at all), my life may
have turned out for the better. The opposite side of the coin when speaking relativistically, is that while you see how
blessed you are compared to those less fortunate, you also see how easier things might have been if put in the shoes of
more well off families.

The most obvious "bad card" I've been dealt was the loss of my father at the age of 16. However, I don't think this had
the obvious, clich√©d effect on my development that you might see in movies. I didn't lash out irrationally, start doing
drugs or petty crime (if anything I had more teen-aged angst before he past). My mom wasn't the best person for support
during this time as she obviously had her own emotions to deal with, but I was pretty independent and still had pretty
good support from friends/extended family.

Instead, the effect this had on me was it made me seek out the comfortable. I started dating a girl and spent a lot of
time with her during the rest of my high school and into my college years. I started looking towards religion as a way
to understand the world. These aren't bad things in themselves, but they did come with a cost. I didn't really make any
new friends during this time, and my religious experience was really only helpful internally. I stopped hanging out with
some good friends, I quit all but one sport, and didn't really push myself academically. What was I doing that was
productive for my mental/physical development at this time? Not much.

In short, I feel as though my social development was stunted, and I'm realizing now how important that is.
