# Taking souls  

Currently, I'm not really in any sort of obvious competitive situation. I
suppose I am trying to juggle three different clients at work right
now. You could say the opponent(s) are any three of them, or my boss.

Honestly, while writing this I'm trying to use that leverage with my boss in
order to get a raise. At the same time, I've been negotiating with recruiters on
potentially switching jobs altogether.

The thing about this situation is that it's not exactly clear how to 'work
harder'. Yes I could just put in more time at each thing, but in some cases,
there isn't necessarily work to be done. A lot of the more high leveraged tasks
involve working with the client, building relationships with them or working
with their agile process.
