# Motivation

Do something every day that makes you uncomfortable in order to harden your mind. 


# Get uncomfortable

The first question to answer here for this challenge is, What are some things
that make me uncomfortable? There are a lot I'm sure, but I'll try to jot some
things out here.

- I don't like getting up early in the morning and running. It's something I
  really dread, especially if the weather isn't ideal. However, I know this is
  something that's good for me because I do usually feel much better throughout
  the day.

- I don't necessarily like talking to new people (or even people you don't talk
  to that often). It takes a lot of energy and is awkward a lot of the time.
  Unlike my last bullet point, I'm not sure how best to go about doing this on a
  daily basis. It's become increasing hard when working from home as well. I guess
  the best I could do with in regards.

- Honestly I don't really like journaling or writing down stuff like what I'm
  currently doing now. I've never been very proficient when it comes to
  grammar/vocabulary and writing things down like this takes me more time than
  it should. This is something I could do everyday though, and might warrant
  more thought when it comes to my Accountability Mirror...

#### UPDATE ~2 weeks later

I proud to say I've run every morning the last couple of weeks. Only a couple of
miles but it's been early (daylight savings switch) and cold none-the-less. The
next couple of weeks should get even easier as it gets lighter and warmer...

I have not done a good job of writing things down or journaling like I'd like to however.
