# Motivation

Paint a picture of not only what success looks like, but also what failures
might occur. So what are my goals? What do I want it to feel like and why am I doing it?


# Visualizing success and challenges

So in the last challenge I've talked about trying to negotiate a raise. I've
pivoted a bit since then to what I feel is a more ambitious goal of becoming an
independent contractor. My goal for this is twofold; to make more money and to
have more skin in the game in terms of my career.

When I think about success for starting this venture, I honestly visualize being
more stressed but at the same time feeling more free if that makes sense. I know
I will probably end up working more hours and have to be more interactive with
my clients, but there's some comfort knowing I'm in control and am the one who
wants to do this.

So as far as challenges, there are several ways this good go south. I could
suddenly be out of a contract and in a hard place to find one. I could end up
making less if I don't get enough hours. The business insurance could end up
costing much more than anticipated. Interacting with clients could be more
challenging. All of these things could put a wrench into my plans, but I do
still feel like the risk is minimal. After all, I do have some savings, my wife
is also working, and we don't have any kids at the moment.

As far as success, like I said, I do envision working more hours, but I
envision doing so in a more controlled/organized way. I see myself more focused
and engaged. I've also felt that being busier at work leads to feeling more
fulfilled and happy as well.
