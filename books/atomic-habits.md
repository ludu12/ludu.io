## What I liked
I've grown fascinated with habits since I read 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg. This book doesn't go into as much scientific detail as that book,
but rather gives some good tips on *how* to create powerful habits.

## What I didn't like
It was a bit short and could have gone into more detail with things.

## What I learned
If you're trying to start a new habit, don't focus on the end goal. Focus on the steps to get there and molding your identity towards being the type of 
person who might have that habit. Also take small and *consistent* steps to get there. If you find yourself losing consistency, start smaller.
